# ðŸ‘¶ Umair's JavaScript Learning Journey ðŸ‘£

Hi everyone! I'm Umair Shakoor, and this repository is a place for me to document my progress as I learn JavaScript. I'm just starting out, so you'll find examples and exercises focused on the fundamentals of JS.  Think of this as my coding notebook!

## What I'm Learning:

This repo is all about the building blocks of JavaScript.  Right now, I'm exploring:

*   **Variables and Data Types:**  Learning how to store information using variables (`var`, `let`, `const`) and understanding different data types like numbers, strings, booleans, etc. (e.g., `variables.js`, `data_types.js`)
*   **Operators:**  Exploring how to work with data using arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /, %), assignment operators (=, +=), comparison operators (==, ===), and logical operators (&&, ||, !). (e.g., `operators.js`)
*   **Control Flow:**  Practicing how to control the order in which my code runs using conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`) and loops (`for`, `while`). (e.g., `conditionals.js`, `loops.js`)
*   **Functions:**  Learning to define and use functions to organize my code and make it reusable.  Understanding parameters, arguments, and return values. (e.g., `functions.js`)
* And Many More!!

## What to Expect:

*   **Simple and Clear Examples:**  The code here is designed to be as easy to understand as possible, focusing on one concept at a time.
*   **Lots of Comments:** I'm adding comments to my code to explain what each part does.  Hopefully, this makes it easier to follow along.
*   **Work in Progress:**  This is a learning repository, so it's constantly growing and changing as I learn new things.  Expect updates and improvements!

## How to Explore:

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/UmairShakoor/JS.git`
2.  Navigate to the directory: `cd JS`
3.  Open the JavaScript files in your browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12) or run them using Node.js.  You can see the output of the code in the console.

## Learning Resources I'm Finding Helpful:

*   [CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry) - Excellent tutorials and explanations.
*   [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - A great resource!
